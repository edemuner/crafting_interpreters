This is a project made alongside the great book Crafting Interpreters by Robert Nystrom, where the author guides the building of a brand new interpreter for a programming language called Lox, first in Java (where it's called JLox) and then in C. 
This is an excellent project to learn fundamentals of programming languages, interpreters and compilers, as the author provides plenty of guidance through several important concepts.
