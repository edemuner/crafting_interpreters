Interpreter has several checks for numbers being Double, but they end up being passed as Integers - FIXED
by setting a double.parseDouble at the number scanning even when there's not dot in the token value
this looked like a better choice (have every number as double under the hood) because other operations in the interpreter will
call checkNumberOperands that checks for the value being double, along with the PLUS case check that do the same
so changing the scanner should fit both scenarios

lines are being miscount - and they shouldn't show up at repl mode

repl mode need an error handling in some places so that to throw the error and allow the user to send another command, instead of breaking the app
